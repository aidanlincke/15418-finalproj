### Title
Parallelized Path Planning Algorithms, by Aidan Lincke (alincke) and Soren Dupont (sdupont)

### Summary
Our plan for this project is to implement a number of path planning algorithms on graphs that have some level of parallelism that can be exploited, but that is difficult to extract, and compare which algorithms best lend themselves to parallel speedup. We will use OpenMP to program familiar graph search algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm. Probabilistic roadmaps, which involves a higher degree of parallelism for generating random point, may be well suited for parallism via CUDA.
